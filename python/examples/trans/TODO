- create 'translation configuration file' which gets placed
  in application root or template root directory. This should
  specify all paramaters which are currently hardcoded in
  trans.py.
  
  Require the user to supply this configuration file each time
  trans is called.

- extend database schema to handle more than one application
  in a single trans database.

- make web UI for browsing trans database

- clearsilver/trans 'z-tag live language QA system' like
  we had at egroups
