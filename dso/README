This directory builds a "dynamic shared object" or dso.  In theory, you
could use this for various things, but in reality this is for the
Mono/CSharp module, which requires a shared library loadable by the C#
run time.

Building this dso is very system specific, and this is currently very
Linux specific at the moment.  Patches to build this on other platforms
are appreciated.
