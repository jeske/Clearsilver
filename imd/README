To set up imd, you need to add the following directives to an apache
conf file.  If you have sufficient permissions, you can add these to the
.htaccess files for an image directory:

AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
AddHandler imd-handler .imd
Action imd-handler /url/path/to/imd.cgi

Then, copy example.imd to somewhere in your URL space, and modify the
settings in there.  You will probably need to modify Template to point
to the installed location of the imd.cs file.  You can personalize the
imd.cs file to personalize your image server.
