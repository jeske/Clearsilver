ClearSilver is a fast, powerful, and language-neutral HTML template system. 
In both static content sites and dynamic HTML applications, it provides a 
separation between presentation code and application logic which makes 
working with your project easier.

Because it's written as a C-library, and exported to scripting languages 
like Python, Perl, and Ruby via modules, it is extremely fast compared to template 
systems written in a script language.
